## Requirements
1. As a user, I want to see on the Home Screen a list of my recommended playlists. When I click on a playlist I want to see more details about it.

Don't forget to:
- enable charles proxy on the device, since it is redirected to "http://localhost.charlesproxy.com:3000/"
- turn on Mockoon
